## SALARY-PREDICTION-ANALYSIS

Our primary objective with this salary prediction project is to accurately estimate salaries based on critical attributes such as job title, job category, and work location and various other as well. This requires us to consider the intricate interactions between these factors and their influence on salary levels across different roles and titles. 

#### KEY FINDINGS:
Linear Regression stands out as the best model for predicting salary. It has the lowest RMSE and highest RÂ² values, indicating it provides the most accurate and consistent predictions with the highest explanatory power for the variance in the target variable![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74de8c35-bc8c-4612-8d52-e3ca51bec2d7)
